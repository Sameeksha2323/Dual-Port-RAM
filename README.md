Specification:
The dual-port RAM features two independent ports, A and B, allowing both ports to perform read and write operations independently or simultaneously. Each operation (read or write) is synchronized to its respective portâ€™s clock. Both ports have dedicated input and output connections, including data_in, wr_en (write enable), rd_en (read enable), data_out, clock, and address lines. The table below provides a description of each pin for a dual-port RAM with synchronous read functionality and separate clocks for each port.
